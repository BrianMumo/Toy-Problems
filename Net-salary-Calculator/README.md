This is net salary calculator.

In the home page, user is prompted to enter details such as: Basic Salary, Total benefits, Tier and pensionable pay.

With entries from the user, my index.js code calculates total deductions(NSSF,NHIF and PAYEE) then gross salary.

Finally, the net salary is calculated and displayed in the table.
